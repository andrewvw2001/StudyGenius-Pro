## Our Solution
We developed a cutting-edge application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide interactive study materials and tools, improving the efficacy and efficiency of students' educational experiences. 

Our application includes four main features users can interact with: 
1. **User Survey:** This will ask the user a series of questions about their preferred learning style, level of understanding in the course, and their confidence level. Once answered, they can access a list of resources geared to their preferences.
2. **Lesson Planner:** Users can break down the many chapters and subjects that need to be studied to create a study plan or guide that will help them organize their study time.
3. **Study Material Generator:** Uses user-provided text to create personalized learning notes or quizzes, providing a personalized and interesting learning experience.
4. **Summary & Quiz Generator:** Reduces the amount of time needed to read lengthy texts and makes more interactive study sessions possible by condensing PDF files into brief summaries and creating multiple-choice quiz questions.
